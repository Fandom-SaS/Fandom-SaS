# Save your code here!

Hello and welcome to Fandom *SaS* (Scripts and Stylesheets)! The place where you can save and manage the code that you use to personalize and improve your Fandom wiki(s). This profile serves as a host for different repositories which holds any of the css, js, or any other language files that you might use on your wiki projects.

## About

If you're a dedicated person which edits wikis' styles and scripts in a organized way (such as saving different assets on different folders and seprating the assets by which things they affect [such as a css file for templates, and other css file for the main page]), you might want to have a place online to safely save it without creating unused MediaWiki pages which only adds junk links to the total amount of pages a wiki has. This can also be useful if you want to start practicing having a more ordered enviroment for editing CSS and JS in a wiki, since by using this model, you can do stuff like design a wiki using multiple [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax) files within a folder, compile it into a single, minified CSS file using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and use this minified code into your MediaWiki:Wikia.css for better loading performance.

The purpose of this account is to keep any assets that you might use for your wikis organized and safe in a dedicated repository for each wiki, which all administrators (and people whose access has been explicitly allowed by an administrator) can access and edit. All you need is basic knowledge of Git and Github, an account of both, and you're ready to go!

With this, you won't have to worry about loosing your progress if something terrible happens to your device, since you will have everything set as the last time you pushed a change to the repo, and also have all the neat features Fandom has to keep your changes logged such as file (or, in this case, commit) history, option to revert commits, and more!

If you're new to GitHub, you might want to take a look at [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) to quickly get started.

## How to use

Simply request an [administrator](#administrators) to create a repo of your wiki. Along that, give the next info:

* A link to the list of administrators of the requested wiki(s).
* A link to your Fandom profile.
* The name of your GitHub profile.
* (Optional) Mention other people you want to have access to the repo along with their profile link(s) on the wiki(s) they want to participate and their GitHub names.
